	  3. To show that I can setup a website.<br>
	  4. I am looking for some serious learning opportunities<br>
	  5. Please hire me if you have an opportunity<br>

      <h3>Sorry that this page sucks</h3>
      <p>Just cause it sucks now, doesn't mean it will continue to suck.<br>
	  I haven't added a picture of me because why would anyone want to see that?<br>
	  And I haven't added anything unnecessary, cause well, it's unnecessary.<br>
	  Huh, talk about ironic.</p>

      <h3>More about me</h3>        
      <p>I am not a bigshot, I've spent most of my time in the past fooling around.<br>
	  "I am passsionate about Coding/Analytics/ML" - I don't know why people put this up in their pages, but if you're the kind with a fetish for it, there you go.<br>
